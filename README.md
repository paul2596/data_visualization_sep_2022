# Visualization Dashboard to Analyze the Spread of a Disease from Simulation Data

### Objectives
- To study the uncertainty and impact of the disease. 
- Build dashboards with appropriate interactions that help convey the data story through the patterns identified.
- Help in deciding the deployment of limited tactical resources (medics and medical supplies) based the visualization.

For the visualization of the coordinates map plot is used which shows the infected areas and spread of the disease. 
Stacked area chart is used in the dashboard to show the average infected in each population size

The visualization shows the areas in need of aid through a colour gradient from a shade of yellow indicating least infected to a darker shade of magenta to indicate the increase in need of aid.

### Color Blind Friendly Palette
For the map a shade of yellow to darker shade of magenta is used. Similarly, for the plot of average infected colours are used from IBMâ€™s colour-blind safe palette. Colour gradient used for the map points for visualizing infected values can be distinguished even on a grey scale.
